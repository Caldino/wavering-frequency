Maximus was a soldier for most of his life before being enrolled in the Mars prohect. He has mild PTSD that he didn't notify any of the doctors of until he arrived on the ship. He was stripped of his rank of Major, and had to start over again. On the way to the Mars colony, the ship powers down it's engines. Maximus is sent to investigate, when he finds both pilots dead at the seat, each of them with a giant bloody hole in the back of their heads. The story begins from the morning after finding the pilots dead.
